## 1. Question Types

Defined in `src/components/admin/questions/question-form-modal.tsx` (`Q_TYPES` array).  
These are the **admin-facing** types used when creating questions in the dashboard.

| Type | Label | Description | Min Answers | Max Answers | Multi-correct |
|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `MCQ_SINGLE` | Multiple Choice | One correct answer from a list | 2 | 5 | ❌ |
| `MCQ_MULTIPLE` | Multi-Select | Multiple correct answers | 3 | 5 | ✅ |
| `TRUE_FALSE` | True / False | Binary choice (True or False) | 2 | 2 | ❌ |
| `IMAGE_BASED` | Image Based | Visual scenario — answers may include images | 2 | 4 | ❌ |
| `MATCHING` | Matching | Match items from two sets (pairs) | 2 | 6 | ❌ |
| `FILL_BLANK` | Fill in the Blank | Complete the missing word(s) | 1 | 5 | ❌ |

### Notes
- `IMAGE_BASED` is only available for categories with `IMAGE_MATCH_SLUGS`: **road-sign** and **priority**.
- `MCQ_MULTIPLE` requires at least 2 correct answers to be marked.
- `MATCHING` pairs are stored as answer rows with metadata JSON.
- `FILL_BLANK` accepts 1–5 acceptable answer variants.

## 2. Runtime Game Types

At runtime, the 6 admin types collapse into **3 engine-level game types** via `mapContentToGameType()` in `src/lib/game-engine.ts`.  
These drive the `AnswerGrid` component rendering.

| Runtime Type | Maps From | Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| `true_false` | Any question with exactly **2 answers** | Large binary buttons (True / False) |
| `image_pick` | Questions with an **image** + 2–4 answers | Image thumbnail answer grid |
| `mcq` | Everything else | Standard A / B / C / D answer grid |

```ts
// Mapping logic (game-engine.ts)
export function mapContentToGameType(params: {
  answerCount: number;
  hasImage: boolean;
  hasAudio: boolean;
}): "mcq" | "true_false" | "image_pick" {
  if (params.answerCount === 2) return "true_false";
  if (params.hasImage && params.answerCount >= 2 && params.answerCount <= 4) return "image_pick";
  return "mcq";
}
```

## 5. Scoring System

Defined in `src/lib/game-engine.ts` — `calculateScore()`.

### 5.1 Base Score by Difficulty

| Difficulty | Base Points |
|---|:---:|
| Easy | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Hard | 3 |

### 5.2 Speed Bonus

Only applies in **speed scoring mode**.

```
speedBonus = +1 if answered within the first 50% of the time limit (fast answer)
           = 0  if answered in the second half of the time window
```

- **Disabled** if answer was submitted in under 500ms (anti-cheat)

### 5.3 Streak Bonus

| Consecutive Correct Answers | Bonus Points |
|---|:---:|
| 2–4 in a row | +1 |
| 5+ in a row | +2 |

- **Disabled** if answer was submitted in under 500ms (anti-cheat)

### 5.4 Total Score Formula

```
totalPoints = baseScore + speedBonus + streakBonus
```

**Maximum per question (speed mode, hard difficulty, 5+ streak):** 6 points  
**Typical correct answer (medium, no streak/speed bonus):** 2 points

### 5.5 Scoring Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `speed` | Base + speed bonus + streak bonus |
| `equal` | Base + streak bonus only (no time pressure) |

### 5.6 Anti-Cheat

Answers submitted in **< 500ms** are flagged as suspicious.  
Suspicious answers receive **0 speed bonus** and **0 streak bonus** (base score only).

### 5.7 Score Authority

- **Live multiplayer**: Score calculated server-side only in `/api/game/sessions/[code]/answer`
- **Solo / Category Quiz**: Score calculated server-side in `/api/game/solo/complete`. Client shows a cosmetic display score using the same formula for real-time feedback, but the **final displayed score is always the server result**.

## 6. Game Session Lifecycle

### Solo Session

```
setup → loading → playing (Q1 → Q2 → ... → Qn) → results
```

1. **setup** — user picks mode and question count
2. **loading** — API call to `/api/game/solo` creates session + fetches questions
3. **playing** — countdown timer per question, answer recorded via API
4. **results** — score breakdown, accuracy %, personal best check

### Live Multiplayer Session

```
lobby → active ⇄ paused → ended
```

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `lobby` | Players joining, waiting for host to start |
| `active` | Game running, questions advancing |
| `paused` | Host paused mid-game |
| `ended` | Game over, final leaderboard shown |

Valid transitions:
- `lobby` → `active` or `ended`
- `active` → `paused` or `ended`
- `paused` → `active` or `ended`
- `ended` → *(terminal, no further transitions)*

Session codes are **6-character alphanumeric** (e.g. `AB3X7K`), generated server-side.
